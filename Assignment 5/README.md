# Assignment 5

## Purpose:
In this assignment we have to save the todo data in Mobile Local Storage. We can use sql lite, hive or any other package..

## Notes:
I tried to use database with SharedPreferences but I doesn't work. I can't even add Tasks and I don't know why. I searched online but I couldn't figure out so I'm gonna learn how it's done in class.
